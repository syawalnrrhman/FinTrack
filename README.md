# FinTrack - Web-Based Personal Finance Dashboard with Actionable Insights

FinTrack is a personal finance web application designed to help users record income and expenses, monitor cash flow and gain **assertive yet empathetic financial insights**.

Unlike typical finance trackers that only display numbers, FinTrack focuses on helping users **understand what thier financial data means** and **what small, realistic actions can be taken next**, especially for users with limited or unstable income.

This project is built as a real-world learning project combining financial analysis, backend development and data visualization.

## 🎯 Project Goals
- Provide a simple and accessible personal finance tracker
- Translate financial data into **clear, actionable insights**
- Deliver financial suggestions that are **firm, realistic and non-judgemental**
- Design recommendations that are friendly for **low to middle income users**
- Build a mobile-friendly web application that can be accessed anytime

## ✨ Key Features
- Record income and expenses transactions
- View transaction history (ledger-style)
- Automatic cash flow calculation
- Financial performance dashboard
- Monthly financial health summary
- Rule-based personal finance insights
- Responsive design (mobile & desktop)

## 💡  Financial Insight Philosophy
FinTrack does not aim to give generic or unrealistic financial advice.

Instead, insights are:
- Based on **user's actual flow**
- Compared against basic **financial safety thresholds**
- Focused on **progress, not perfection**
- Delivered in an **assertive but supportive tone**

Example:
> "Your remaining cash flow this month is very limited.
> With your current income level, maintaining at least a small buffer could improve financial stability next month."

## 🧠 Insight System (Planned)
Insight are generated using **rule-based financial logic**, not machine learning.

Initial indicators include:
- Cash flow stability
- Savings effort
- Expanse distribution
- Month-to-month spending trend

Each Period, the system provides:
- A simple financial health score
- 1-2 key insights
- One realistic suggested action

## 🛠  Tech Stack (Planned)
- Backend: Python (Flask / FastAPI)
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, Javascript
- Database: SQLite
- Visualization: Chart.js
- Deployment: Render / Vercel
